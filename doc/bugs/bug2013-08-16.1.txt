2013-08-16.1 Stuck input key
----------------------------

Status : [**Bug**, Fixing, Fixed, CNR] 

Description
:   A key can get stuck.  This was seen a few times when first starting the game.  Try
    hitting random keys and/or Esc during startup and the first animation sequence. 
    Doesn't happen consistently.

	This happens on windows.  The current circular buffer implementation can cause an
	event to get dropped.  If it is a key up then the key will be considered down.  The
	workaround is to press the stuck key again.
Expected Behaviour
:   Keys should not get stuck.
