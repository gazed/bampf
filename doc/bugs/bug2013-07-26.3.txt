2013-07-26.3 Player stuck on outside corner. 
--------------------------------------------

Status : [Bug, Fixing, Fixed, **CNR**] 

Description
:   As seen. One particular corner, slide and get stuck left side of corridor opening
    up on another corridor. Only this one in particular...move mouse a little to right
    and still stuck. Little bit more, now okay. Not seen in other sections of the maze. 
    Tried lots of sliding at Lvl 2-3-4-5, only that 1.
Expected Behaviour
:   Player shouldn't get stuck on outside corner.
