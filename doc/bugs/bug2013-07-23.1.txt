2013-07-23.1 Start button overlaps window trim. 
-----------------------------------------------

Status : [**Bug**, Fixing, Fixed, CNR] 

Description
:   Resizing the window such that the start button overlaps the window trim
    can cause the game to start as if the user moves the window by clicking
    on the window trim.  This can also happen if the box overlaps one of the
    windows corners and the user attempts to resize the window. 

    Need to test if this happens on Windows.

    One solution is to limit the window size so that it can't be made so small
    that the overlap happens.
       On OSX : NSWindow setContentMinSize
       On Win : Respond to WindowProc WM_GETMINMAXINFO
    However limiting the user's window size is out of proportion with the
    seriousness of the bug. 

Expected Behaviour
:   The window border should take precendence over the game button.
