Bampf
=====

You, an immortal of pure energy and will, are striving to create a permanent physical form.
Using your energy flow to create, move, and gather Energy Cores it may be possible to reach
a critical mass that will bring you to a more physical dimension. Knowledge is only
the beginning of what might be gained.

**Plain Speak**

Bampf is a simple 3D arcade style game. Collect Energy Cores in order to finish 
a level. Teleport (bampf) to safety or use cloaking abilities to avoid Sentinels.

Start 
-----

Choose your level of difficulty or start at the lowest level and work your way up.
The level difficulties are:

* **One** Practice.
* **Two** Standard.
* **Three** Challenging.
* **Four** Almost Impossible.
* **Five** Impossible. Try for a high Energy Core count. 

Optionally rebind the keys to the main game actions using the options screen.  The options
screen can be opened (and closed) using the ``Esc`` key.  Binding keys is done by hovering
the mouse over the desired action button and clicking the desired key or mouse button.

Play 
----

Move around using the movement keys (standard W, A, S, D defaults) and change your orientation 
by moving the mouse. Travel over Energy Cores to collect them. Finish the level by getting to the 
center once you have collected the necessary Energy Cores.

The game screen elements are:

**Teleport Energy Bar**
:   Small bar center left. Teleport energy replenishes over time.
**Cloaking Energy Bar**
:   Small bar center right. Cloaking energy replenishes by collecting cores but you can't 
    collect cores or finish the level while cloaked.
**Energy Cores Collected Bar**
:   Big bar across the bottom showing the number of Energy Cores collected and the number of 
    Energy Cores needed to finish the level.
**Portrait**
:   Bottom left image of your avatar that is updated as you gain or lose Energy Cores.
**Minimap**
:   Shows what is immediately around you from an overhead perspective.

End

There is one, but its only available after finishing the impossible last level. Its not 
terribly interesting so enjoy the game knowing you're not missing much.
